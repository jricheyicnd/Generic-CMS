This is a generic CMS with a couple of pre-installed modules:

- Pages

- Contacts

You will need to update the following files/info:

1. /config/settings.cfm

	- update the datasource names
	
	<cfset set(dataSourceName='changethis')>
	<cfset application.dsn = 'changethis'>


2. /config/environment.cfm

	- when site goes live, update this to 'production'
